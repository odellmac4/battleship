### Odell and Kevin Battleship Project
1. We did not get to iteration 3 due to a pretty particular issue that we finally we're able to solve.

 We would have read the instructions line by line, then piece out the problem into smaller, manageable, chunks. We would still use tdd as a guide, especially since there is no iteration pattern.

 2. If we had more time, I'm confident we would have gotten to iteration 3. We spent almost 7 hours on that unforeseen issue and still almost got to iteration 3 due to trying to use a class method. So we would primarily be working on the implementation phase of the project.

 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
	We started off by working alone to set up each class and its corresponding test so that when we started paired programming, we could focus on building out more complex methods. When working together we traded off on who would build out the method and the test, while the other would help with research and documentation.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

We began each session with feedback. Feedback included:
- What could we make better
- How we could refactor
- How we should manage git workflow for that session

The feedback we provided to each other was actionable and helped each of us learn from the mistakes we made while developing our code.
